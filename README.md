# Landing Page (The Odin Project)
This is a template for a website's landing page. It features four sections with different purposes and features as well as a header and a footer.

This project was done for the Foundations part of the The Odin Project's course, in which the challenge was to try to create this page given [this image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) and [this color/font sheet](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png).

You can check the final result through [this link](https://martimn98.github.io/odin-landing-page/).
